# What is gradia?

**gradia** is a tiny JavaScript library which provides simple gradient-based optimizers like SGD, Adam etc. This is useful when fancy deep learning features are not required but you need optimizers.

Even I'm trying to do my best, note that this is not performance friendly. For those heavy purpose, please consider other nice frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

The main interests I have are practicing functional paradigm. Also I just want to learn some brand new optimizers like AdaBound.
